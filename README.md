# ReReSo Schemas and JVM Tooling

The ReReSo Project seeks to improve the *re*usability of *re*search *so*ftware by standardizing
benchmark and tool formats as well as metadata to describe them. While the metadata formats are
expected to be community-agnostic, the benchmark formats utilize _layered_ combinations of
community-specific schemata.

This repository contains:

1. metadata schemata for tools and benchmarks,
2. benchmark schemata for log files (i.e., sequences of events that may additionally contain, e.g.,
   temporal information), and
3. Kotlin-based tools to work with these formats on the JVM (see the badge for Maven Central
   releases).
